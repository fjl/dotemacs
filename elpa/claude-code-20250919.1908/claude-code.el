;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides integration with Claude Code CLI tool within Emacs.
;; It allows you to run Claude Code sessions in vterm buffers with project isolation.
;;
;; Main features:
;; - Project-specific Claude Code sessions
;; - Transient menu for common operations
;; - File path completion with @ syntax
;; - Custom commands support
;; - MCP server integration with real-time event notifications
;;
;; Optional dependencies:
;; - lsp-mode (9.0.0): For LSP diagnostic fixing and MCP tools
;; - websocket (1.15): For MCP server WebSocket communication
;;
;; These are only required if you want to use MCP features or LSP diagnostics.
;;
;; Quick start:
;;
;;   (require 'claude-code)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'claude-code-transient)
;;
;; Basic usage:
;;
;;   M-x claude-code-run      ; Start Claude Code session
;;   C-c c                          ; Open transient menu
;;   C-u M-x claude-code-run  ; Start with options (model, resume, etc.)
;;
;; In prompt buffer (.claude-code.prompt.md):
;;   @ TAB                          ; Complete file paths
;;   C-c C-s                        ; Send section at point
;;   C-c C-b                        ; Send entire buffer
;;
;; MCP integration (optional):
;;
;;   M-x claude-code-install-mcp-server  ; Install MCP server
;;   ;; Then configure Claude Code as instructed
;;
;; For more information, see README.md
