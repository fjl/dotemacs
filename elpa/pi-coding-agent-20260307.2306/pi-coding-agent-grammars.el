;;; Commentary:

;; Tree-sitter grammar recipes and installation helpers for Emacs 29+.
;;
;; All built-in `-ts-mode's (python-ts-mode, bash-ts-mode, etc.) are
;; available on Emacs 29, 30, and 31.  The modes are there; the
;; *grammars* (compiled .so files) are what users need to install.
;;
;; On Emacs 29/30, `treesit-language-source-alist' starts empty — users
;; have no way to install grammars without knowing Git URLs.  This file
;; registers version-pinned recipes so `treesit-install-language-grammar'
;; works out of the box.
;;
;; On Emacs 31, `treesit-ensure-installed' handles grammars natively for
;; modes that register recipes.  Our entries serve as fallbacks for modes
;; that don't (add-to-list with APPEND preserves user/mode entries).
