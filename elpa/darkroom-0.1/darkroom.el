;;; Commentary:

;; The main entrypoints to this extension are two minor modes:
;;
;;    M-x darkroom-mode
;;    M-x darkroom-tentative-mode
;;
;; `darkroom-mode' makes visual distractions disappear: the
;; mode-line is temporarily elided, text is enlarged and margins are
;; adjusted so that it's centered on the window.
;;
;; `darkroom-tentative-mode' is similar, but it doesn't immediately
;; turn-on `darkroom-mode', unless the current buffer lives in the
;; sole window of the Emacs frame (i.e. all other windows are
;; deleted). Whenever the frame is split to display more windows and
;; more buffers, the buffer exits `darkroom-mode'. Whenever they are
;; deleted, the buffer re-enters `darkroom-mode'.
;;
;; Personally, I always use `darkroom-tentative-mode'.
;;
;; See also the customization options `darkroom-margins' and
;; `darkroom-fringes-outside-margins', which affect both modes.

- a cons cell (LEFT RIGHT) specifying the left and right margins
  in columns.

- a function of a single argument, a window, that returns a cons

  `darkroom-guess-margins', which see. Beware that this function
