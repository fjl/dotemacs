;;; Commentary:

;; Library for generic timestamp handling.  It is targeted at bulk
;; processing, therefore many functions are optimized for speed, but
;; not necessarily for ease of use.  For example, formatting is done
;; in two steps: first you need to generate a formatting function for
;; given pattern, and only using it obtain formatted strings.
;;
;; Package's main feature currently is timestamp formatting based on
;; Java pattern.  Arbitrary timezones and locales (i.e. not
;; necessarily those used by the system) are supported.  See function
;; `datetime-float-formatter' for details.
;;
;; Library also supports timestamp matching.  It can generate regular
;; expressions that match timestamps corresponding to given pattern.
;; These regular expressions can give false positives, but for most
;; purposes are good enough to detect timestamps in text files,
;; e.g. in various application logs.  See `datetime-matching-regexp'.
;;
;; Finally, library provides functions to select an appropriate
;; timestamp format for given locale.  For example, function
;; `datetime-locale-date-pattern' returns a Java pattern suitable for
;; formatting date only, without time part.  However, it is not
;; required that formats are generated this way.
;;
;; Timestamp parsing is currently not implemented, but planned for a
;; future version.


;;; Code:


;; Internally any date-time pattern is parsed to a list of value pairs
;; (type . details).  Type is a symbol, while details are either nil,
;; another symbol or a number that represents minimum number of
;; characters in formatted number (left padded with zeros).  The only
;; exception is "as-is" part: it is just a string, not a cons cell.
;;
;; Here are all currently used types with details in parentheses,
;; grouped roughly by represented date-time value.  Context/standalone
;; is meaningful for languages that involve flexing, for English they
;; are the same.
;;
;; In all cases these should be seen as internals and can be changed
;; in a future library versions without prior notice.

;; There are many fallbacks involved to reduce size:
;;   - for locale XX-YY value for any property defaults to that of
;;     locale XX;
;;   - `:decimal-separator' defaults to dot;
;;   - `:eras' and `:am-pm' default to English version;
;;   - month/dayweek standalone abbreviations or names default to
;;     the corresponding context-aware property;
;;   - date-time patterns are not stored, instead they are built from
;;     date and time parts for that locale; corresponding field is a
;;     cons with car determining what should be in the beginning (t
;;     for date, nil for time), and cdr being the separator string;
;;     the cons defaults to (t . " ");
;;   - all patterns have the following fallbacks: `:short' defaults to
;;     `:medium', `:long' defaults to `:medium', `:full' defaults to
;;     `:long'.

  :locale

    Locale (language) used for month, weekday etc. names.  Always
    defaults to English, even if system locale is different.  You
    can use special value \\='system to let the library find it.

  :timezone

    Timezone for time values to be formatted in.  Always defaults
    to UTC.  You can use special value \\='system to let the
    library find the value, suitable for the current machine.

(defun datetime-matching-regexp (type pattern &rest options)
  "Return a regexp that matches date-time according to the PATTERN.
Argument TYPE defines how the pattern should be interpreted, see
library documentation.  Rest of the arguments must be a property
list, i.e. keywords interleaved with values.

Returned regexp contains only \"shy\" groups, so it can be
inserted into a larger one without screwing group ordering.  Note
that the returned regexp as a whole is not enclosed in a group;
when inserting you need to take that into account where
necessarily.

Note that the returned regexp will match some incorrect dates
too.  It is supposed to be used as a good and fast estimation if
a string represents date-time formatted according to PATTERN, but
it is not strict enough to be used as a validator.

OPTIONS should be any keyword arguments understood by
`datetime-recode-pattern' plus any from the list below, specific
to this function.

The function understands several keyword arguments to subtly
tweak the produced regexp.  Many of these flags can be used to
discard valid date-time strings.  They are still useful because
\"can be parsed\" is not necessarily equal to \"valid in this
context\".  Default value of keyword arguments is nil unless
specified otherwise.

  :locale

    Locale (language) used for month, weekday etc. names.  Always
    defaults to English, even if system locale is different.  You
    can use special value \\='system to let the library find it.

  :only-4-digit-years

    Match only four consecutive digits as a year assuming the
    pattern contains a 4-digit year placeholder.  By default any
    number of digits will be accepted.  This can be seen as a
    special case of :require-leading-zeros for year field only.

  :lax-whitespace

    Match any whitespace in PATTERN against any whitespace in
    date-time string.  For this purpose \"whitespace\" is defined
    as space and tab characters only.

  :accept-leading-space

    Make variable-width numbers (e.g. day number without leading
    zero) match also if there is a leading space.

  :require-leading-zeros

    Make numbers that are formatted with leading zeros in PATTERN
    only match when there are corresponding zeros in the string.

  :forbid-unnecessary-zeros

    Don't match more leading zeros than required by the pattern.
    E.g. \"030 September\" is a valid date, but no-one writes it
    like that and with this flag such strings are not matched."
