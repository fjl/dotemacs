;; # Olivetti #

;; A simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.

;; ## Features ##

;; - Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins to
;;   keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.
;; - Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a fraction
;;   of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
;; - Interactively change body width with:
;;   olivetti-shrink C-c { { { ...
;;   olivetti-expand C-c } } } ...
;;   olivetti-set-width C-c \
;; - If olivetti-body-width is an integer, the text body width will scale with
;;   use of text-scale-mode, whereas if a fraction (float) then the text body
;;   width will remain at that fraction.
;; - Optionally remember the state of visual-line-mode on entry and recall its
;;   state on exit.

;; Olivetti keeps everything it does buffer-local, so you can write prose in one
;; buffer and code in another, side-by-side in the same frame. For those looking
;; for a hardcore distraction-free writing mode with a much larger scope, I
;; recommend writeroom-mode: https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode.

;; ## Requirements ##

;; - Emacs 25.3

;; ## Installation ##

;; The latest stable release of Olivetti is available via [MELPA-stable]
;; and can be installed with:

;;     M-x package-install RET olivetti RET

;; Alternately, download the [latest release], move this file into your
;; load-path and add to your .emacs/init.el file:

;;     (require 'olivetti)

;; If you prefer the latest but perhaps unstable version, install via
;; [MELPA], or clone the repository into your load-path and require as
;; above:

;;     git clone https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti.git

;; [melpa]: https://melpa.org/#/olivetti "MELPA"
;; [melpa-stable]: https://stable.melpa.org/#/olivetti "MELPA-stable"
;; [latest release]: https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/releases/latest "Olivetti latest release"

;; ## Contributing ##

;; Please report bugs and request features at:
;; https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/issues

;; ## Hints ##

;; To always use a different width for a specific file, set a File
;; Variable:

;;     M-x add-file-local-variable RET olivetti-body-width RET 66 RET

;; See (info "(emacs) File Variables")
